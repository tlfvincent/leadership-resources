## Personal Musings


- Establish processes early, and seek input from your team while doing so.
- In some cases, suboptimal but thoughful constraints will need to be bargained into the processes. Make sure to revisit these constraints if they often get linked to escalations, and adapt your processes accordingly.
- Don't undermine your work by allowing for many exceptions to the process. Instead, work and iterate on the processes early and often.
